# Week 3+4 - The Golden Square

## What is the Golden Square?

The Golden Square refers to four software engineering practices:

1. Test-Driving (TDD)
2. Object-Oriented Design (OOD)
3. Debugging
4. Pairing

This module was focussed on learning how to do each of these things.

## Weekly Goals
1. Learn to test-drive programs with multiple classes.**✓**
2. Learn to break programs up into classes.**✓**
3. Learn to debug your programs.**✓**
4. Learn to build software as a pair.**✓**
5. Learn to explain why test-driving, object-oriented design, debugging, and pairing are powerful practices for software engineers. **✓**

## Reflection


### Question 1

*Did you meet all of your goals to the standard you set at the start of the week?*


- Yes, I feel far more confident with OOP particularly, which was an area of weakness I focused on to address. 



### Question 2

*What would you change/improve moving forward?*


**Technical:**
- I'd love to improve my understanding of more Ruby syntax, in order to write code quicker


**Personal:**
- I'd be stricter with timekeeping and taking breaks
