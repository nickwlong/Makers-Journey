# Week 3+4 - The Golden Square

## What is the Golden Square?

The Golden Square refers to four software engineering practices:

1. Test-Driving (TDD)
2. Object-Oriented Design (OOD)
3. Debugging
4. Pairing

This module was focussed on learning how to do each of these things.

## Weekly Goals
1. Learn to test-drive programs with multiple classes.**✓**
2. Learn to break programs up into classes.**✓**
3. Learn to debug your programs.**✓**
4. Learn to build software as a pair.**✓**
5. Learn to explain why test-driving, object-oriented design, debugging, and pairing are powerful practices for software engineers. **✓**

#### Evidence:
1. To begin with, I worked on a bunch of different challenges and processes that involved testing. These were built with OOD and TDD in mind, with paired programming in the afternoon of each day. To explore some of these projects see here: 

2. Late in the first week, I wanted to face a challenge and decided to build a naughts and crosses terminal game in a pair-programming session. To see the code, go [here](https://github.com/nickwlong/noughts_and_crosses)

3. Using what I had learned from the pair work, I then developed a [Takeaway](https://github.com/nickwlong/TakeawayProject) delivery system. These included various features such as:
* A terminal-based UI
* A menu viewer
* An active basket to store a customer's orders
* A 'receipt' system that shows a customer's orders and their total price to pay.
* An email is sent to the customer upon placing an order, notifying them of their expected delivery time (using Twilio Ruby)
