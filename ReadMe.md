## This is a work in progress, currently back-dating from Module 6!

# Who I am and what is this all about?

My name is Nick, I am a Software Engineer Apprentice working for OVO Energy. This diary is a log of my journey through the first 12 weeks of my apprenticeship, where I will be completing the Makers Academy Bootcamp. Each week I will be sharing my learning objectives, my personal goals, evidence of their completion, and some reflections.

I am not sure which field of the OVO tech team I will be working in, but I hope to gain a range of experiences in my time here. OVO has a big focus on forward-thinking tech use, shown by their tech [blog](https://tech.ovoenergy.com/) and range of [technologies](https://techradar.ovotech.org.uk/) in use.

## Why Software Engineering?

My love of coding started at a young age where my father was coding a speech synthesiser for my brother, who is blind. He was developing software in BASIC that would read out text from a scanned piece of text. I was captivated by the idea that you could build complicated ideas from simple statements and conditionals that would link together. Unfortunately, throughout the rest of my education I had no further exposure to coding until reaching my twenties and dabbling in a little code when working in teaching. Over the past few years I have grown from the ‘go-to’ spreadsheet and data manager within the school to learning coding in my own time. 

### My coding knowledge prior to Makers

Using resources primarily on Codecademy and YouTube, I built a base of knowledge in languages such as Javascript, Ruby, and HTML/CSS. I initially prioritised developing a good understanding of key concepts e.g. arrays and objects, and have made sure to complete projects and coding challenges over time, particularly in Javascript. In the months before beginning the apprenticeship, I explored frameworks and libraries such as React and Phaser.JS, and other languages such as typescript. I have also been investigating the cloud and its strengths, workflows using CD/CI, and the use of GitHub. 

### My previous career

Throughout my teaching career, I have had a range of experiences across work in the classroom and through leadership in schools. As a teacher you have to be organised and self-driven, in a career where the more you can put into the students’ education, the more they will benefit. Effective communication, collaboration, and creativity are key in education and I feel my strengths in these areas will all transfer brilliantly into a career in tech. Teaching science requires you to explain challenging concepts, such as gravitational fields, in a way that students can understand it and apply it to different contexts. In coding, I will be working with colleagues and potentially clients where I will need to do exactly this, and I will be able to distill my team’s code and explain it concisely. Equally, within science, there are new developments all the time and keeping on top of the new discoveries and technologies has been an exciting part of my journey and I look forward to applying this same approach in the tech field. 

### The hopes for the future

As I move further into my career, I hope to swiftly move into leadership roles where I can support others in their work. My experiences in management in schools have given me opportunities to support staff with professional development, data analysis, and improving school systems. Making a difference isn’t just about the coding I am doing, but how I am positively supporting others to grow in themselves and I believe that I bring added value to my teams because of this.
