## Day One:
Joined a retro and sprint-planning meeting with my team. Acronyms and words thrown everywhere that I don't yet understand, this will be a bit of a journey!

I did, however, finish setting up my OVO Macbook and was tasked with submitting my first PR. This was just simply adding my email address to two json files, but it was a significant first step. 

Why does it take so long to download command-line tools?!

I then took some time to explore the various GitHub repositories for my team, and explored a bit of TypeScript.

## Day Two:

I started up the day by completing a couple of OVO-Learn courses (welcome videos and quizzes regarding 'Plan Zero' - the company's climate pledge)
