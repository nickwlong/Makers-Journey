# Week 1+2 - Basic Programming in Ruby

## Weekly Goals
1. Learn to manipulate files and directory structures using the command line. **✓**
2. Learn to track changes to your code using Git version control. **✓**
3. Learn to write small programs using Ruby. **✓**

#### Plans to achieve:
1. Use the Makers resources to develop my understanding of the Ruby language
2. Apply what I have learned to drills and small projects
3. To work with others via pair programming to refactor my code

#### Evidence:
1. 
  - **The module** The module consisted of a number of topics to read and explore, drills [drills](https://github.com/nickwlong/ruby_foundations/tree/main/chapter1/challenges/drills/lib) to practise and challenges to complete. This culminated in producing a basic password manager and later an improved v2.0!

  - **Password Manager v2.0** This challenge was to create a basic password manager using the Ruby we had learned in the first week. [here](https://github.com/nickwlong/ruby_foundations/tree/main/chapter3/challenges) To see my process, watch the following videos that I recorded [part-one](https://youtu.be/EW59cUkOgd8) and [part-two](https://youtu.be/IwOcLh1r8h8).

  - **Refactoring** Having completed the Basic Programming module during the first of two weeks, I was given a follow up challenge to pair with one other and refactor our code. We worked together and reviewed each other's initial solutions before deciding on how we could code a simplified solution. [refactored code](https://github.com/nickwlong/Basics-refactoring/blob/main/SebNick-password_manager.rb)

  - **Refactoring using objects** We had not yet explored object oriented programming, but as an extension we were asked to refactor our password manage by using an object to store passwords and user data. Here is our solution [object-oriented](https://github.com/nickwlong/Basics-refactoring/blob/main/SebNick-ObjectRefactorARRAY.rb)

## Daily Goals
  
  
## Reflection


### Question 1

*Did you meet all of your goals to the standard you set at the start of the week?*


- Yes, I feel far more confident with OOP particularly, which was an area of weakness I focused on to address. 



### Question 2

*What would you change/improve moving forward?*


**Technical:**
- I'd love to improve my understanding of more Ruby syntax, in order to write code quicker


**Personal:**
- I'd be stricter with timekeeping and taking breaks
