## Day One:
Joined a retro and sprint-planning meeting with my team. Acronyms and words thrown everywhere that I don't yet understand, this will be a bit of a journey!

I did, however, finish setting up my OVO Macbook and was tasked with submitting my first PR. This was just simply adding my email address to two json files, but it was a significant first step. 

Why does it take so long to download command-line tools?!

I then took some time to explore the various GitHub repositories for my team, and explored a bit of TypeScript.

## Day Two:

I started up the day by completing a couple of OVO-Learn courses (welcome videos and quizzes regarding 'Plan Zero' - the company's climate pledge), and had an introduction to the workflow of the team. My mentor demonstrated how CircleCI works with regard to continuous integration and continuous development. The code is uploaded to a test base on AWS first, having already been tested by Snyk and various other processes. After checking that the code is running as intended on the UAT, it can be manually passed to production.

## Day Three:

Met with OVO apprentices 

## Day Four:

Introduction to Lambdas - built small hello world function

## Day Five:

Estimation meeting

Set up Strava webhook and basic strava api interaction. Fixed token authentication and refreshing.
