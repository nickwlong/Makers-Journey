Previous week's research goals:
- Research more around 'promises'
- Find more examples of where middleware is used
- Continue to book one-to-one meetings with others in the team

## Day One:

Our team has a bi-weekly retrospective and sprint planning meeting. Unfortunately the sprint planning meeting didn't happen as normal today, as a lot of the previous sprint's work could just carry over. However, the retro was useful as I could contribute and take note of the problems the others in the team were facing.

I was also provided with a lot of detailed feedback on my pull request from last week's ticket. This gave me lots of pointers on how to improve my tests, using better mocking methods, and to improve the logic of my code a lot! In the Bootcamp we were provided feedback at numerous points, but the majority of learning was self-driven or from working in teams with other apprentices. This placement will be helpful by providing me the opportunity to learn from more senior engineers, with lots of experience in industry. 

Through this feedback I explored:
- Various ways to *mock* functions jest.fn() , .spyOn , and .mock()
- Flipping the use of a boolean to simplify some code
- The difference between testing a whole endpoint vs testing the function that is called
- How to mock parameters in an endpoint
- Type allocation in typescript
