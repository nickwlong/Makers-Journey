## What were the highlights of the Bootcamp?

The bootcamp was just fantastic, I loved every second! The structure of the course made every day super satisfying, as I was learning so much! The highlights had to include the final engineering project, I loved the first week of learning Ruby too. The coaches and my cohort were supportive and encouraging. 

## What was the hardest thing?

Going from working alone at my own pace to then working alongside larger teams was a challenge, but something that I gained a lot from. Paired programming, following agile practices, managing a git workflow.. I was then able to work as part of an effective team in the final engineering projects and we built some great projects. 

## What are my worries/concerns about placement?

'Real world' software engineering is working on enormous code bases, compared to those we have produced in the Bootcamp. There are also numerous further platforms/libraries/technologies to learn and work with. My team, for example, deploy their code to AWS using Lambda and other functionalities, all of which I will need to learn. There are also other stages in the development to get familiar with. My concerns initially are about getting overwhelmed with everything, however, I know my mentor will support me by taking things one step at a time and I am excited to learn them all!

## What outstanding questions do I have for my placement coach?

None at this stage.
