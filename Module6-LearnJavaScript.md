# Week 8 - Learning a new language

## Weekly Goals

1. Describe a process for learning a new language
2. Follow an effective process for learning a new language
3. Compare and contrast Javascript and Ruby
4. Test drive a simple front-end web app with Javascript

#### Plans to achieve:

I started the week by asking the question: What would my plan be if I were to start learning another new language tomorrow? 

The main aim will be able to follow specifications to build simple programs in Javascript using TDD and OOD. I will then look to create front-end web apps using Javascript. Test-driven development needs to be at the core of all of this.

1. Use the Makers resources to develop my understanding of the Ruby language
2. Apply what I have learned to drills and small projects
3. To work with others via pair programming to refactor my code

#### Evidence:
1. **Basics of JS** I started by reviewing what I already knew about JavaScript, having worked with it a little before. I found I was confident in using its arrays, functions, and objects but needed a little practice applying its syntax. So I had a go at coding some simple programmes using Jasmine to test the code [for-example](https://github.com/nickwlong/Learning-Javascript/tree/main/1.%20Test-driving%20JS/JasmineWhat/src)
2. **Testing JS development**I then moved on to coding a [thermostat](https://github.com/nickwlong/Learning-Javascript/tree/main/1.%20Test-driving%20JS/Thermostat) using Jest instead to test my code during development. I was missing the brilliant html interface that Jasmine provided, so found out that I can use `jest --coverage` to provide coverage checks and an html interface for showing the code.
3. **Interacting with APIs..** What the Geoff is JSON.parse, and what is GOT and what is the response? How do these callbacks work!?
  This step threw up some big blockers. I had to learn what callbacks were, to ensure that APIs were accessed and handled in order. I also had to get to grips with what JSON was providing (parses text into a data object). I managed to set up access to APIs of [GitHub](https://github.com/nickwlong/Learning-Javascript/blob/main/1.%20Test-driving%20JS/GitClient/githubApi.js) repositories, and for accessing [weather](https://github.com/nickwlong/Learning-Javascript/blob/main/1.%20Test-driving%20JS/WeatherApp/index.js) in certain locations. 

  This led into exploring Express for handling routes in JavaScript -> the next logical step from handling APIs, in the hope that I can attempt the Chitter API challenge. I used a combination of the Makers express resources, and Codecademy's 'Learn Express Routes' course.

4. **Build Javascript Web Apps**
