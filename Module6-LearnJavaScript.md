# Week 1+2 - Basic Programming in Ruby

## Weekly Goals

1. Describe a process for learning a new language
2. Follow an effective process for learning a new language
3. Compare and contrast Javascript and Ruby
4. Test drive a simple front-end web app with Javascript

#### Plans to achieve:

I started the week by asking the question: What would my plan be if I were to start learning another new language tomorrow? 

The main aim will be able to follow a specification to build a simple program in Javascript using TDD and OOD.

1. Use the Makers resources to develop my understanding of the Ruby language
2. Apply what I have learned to drills and small projects
3. To work with others via pair programming to refactor my code

## Reflection


### Question 1

*Did you meet all of your goals to the standard you set at the start of the week?*


- Yes, I feel far more confident with OOP particularly, which was an area of weakness I focused on to address. 



### Question 2

*What would you change/improve moving forward?*


**Technical:**
- I'd love to improve my understanding of more Ruby syntax, in order to write code quicker


**Personal:**
- I'd be stricter with timekeeping and taking breaks
