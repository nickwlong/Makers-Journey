# Week 1+2 - Basic Programming in Ruby

## Weekly Goals
1. Learn to manipulate files and directory structures using the command line. **✓**
2. Learn to track changes to your code using Git version control. **✓**
3. Learn to write small programs using Ruby. **✓**

#### Plans to achieve:
1. Use the Makers resources to develop my understanding of the Ruby language
2. Apply what I have learned to drills and small projects
3. To work with others via pair programming to refactor my code

## Reflection


### Question 1

*Did you meet all of your goals to the standard you set at the start of the week?*


- Yes, I feel far more confident with OOP particularly, which was an area of weakness I focused on to address. 



### Question 2

*What would you change/improve moving forward?*


**Technical:**
- I'd love to improve my understanding of more Ruby syntax, in order to write code quicker


**Personal:**
- I'd be stricter with timekeeping and taking breaks
