# Week 1+2 - Basic Programming in Ruby

## Weekly Goals

1. **Design a database schema with at least two tables** from a specification, including a one-to-many relationship between two tables, and create the schema in a database using SQL. **✓**
2. **Use SQL to query a database** to read data from one table or resulting of a join, create new records, update and delete. **✓**
3. **Integrate a relational database to a program** by test-driving classes which implement CRUD methods to send SQL queries to a database. **✓**

## Reflection


### Question 1

*Did you meet all of your goals to the standard you set at the start of the week?*


- Yes, I feel far more confident with OOP particularly, which was an area of weakness I focused on to address. 



### Question 2

*What would you change/improve moving forward?*


**Technical:**
- I'd love to improve my understanding of more Ruby syntax, in order to write code quicker


**Personal:**
- I'd be stricter with timekeeping and taking breaks
