# Week 5 - Databases (SQL and CRUD methods)

## Weekly Goals

1. **Design a database schema with at least two tables** from a specification, including a one-to-many relationship between two tables, and create the schema in a database using SQL. **✓**
2. **Use SQL to query a database** to read data from one table or resulting of a join, create new records, update and delete. **✓**
3. **Integrate a relational database to a program** by test-driving classes which implement CRUD methods to send SQL queries to a database. **✓**

Here I aimed to work through the full module by the end of the week, and to take on the final challenge too. I accomplished this, grasping the CRUD methods, and the more complicated table relationships (e.g. many-to-many relationships).

#### Evidence:
1. Various tasks involved working with album and artist tables, building more complicated relationships between these tables toward the end of the week. See the repository [here](https://github.com/nickwlong/Database_projects).
2. As a feedback-based project, I completed a little challenge on a [bookstore](https://github.com/nickwlong/book_store)
3. Another project was to create a basic social media backend with accounts and posts. See [here](https://github.com/nickwlong/social_network/tree/main/lib)
2. For the final project, I built a Shop Manager. Like in the previous week, this was a terminal-based UI program that took various orders. See the code and try running it from [here](https://github.com/nickwlong/shop-manager-challenge/blob/main/lib/application.rb).
