# Week 8 - Learning a new language

## Weekly Goals

1. Describe a process for learning a new language
2. Follow an effective process for learning a new language
3. Compare and contrast Javascript and Ruby
4. Test drive a simple front-end web app with Javascript

#### Plans to achieve:

I started the week by asking the question: What would my plan be if I were to start learning another new language tomorrow? 

The main aim will be able to follow specifications to build simple programs in Javascript using TDD and OOD. I will then look to create front-end web apps using Javascript. Test-driven development needs to be at the core of all of this.

1. Use the Makers resources to develop my understanding of the Ruby language
2. Apply what I have learned to drills and small projects
3. To work with others via pair programming to refactor my code

#### Evidence:
1. **Week One** WHAAT?! Where do we start? We were shown some existing code for an "Acebook" app, using technologies including:
* JavaScript
* React
* MongoDB
* Mongoose
* Express
* Jest
* Cypress
* JWT 

I had used JavaScript and Express a little previously, but no Mongo or React, and I had no idea what a token represented. However, we started the first day by setting a goal of deciding how we would work as a team and set out to find out the basic structure of the files etc.

Initially, the codebase had features to allow signup, log in, and view posts. However, we didn't have any test posts to view nor a feature to implement. So I found a way to insert many test posts, and we had our first feed of posts visible!

By using our trello board, stand-up meetings, and coding in pairs/threes, we implemented some basic features in the first week. For example, reverse-chronological sorting of posts, styling posts as 'cards', and adding the 'date-posted' to each post. We hit a significant blocker when trying to linking tables of data together using MongoDB, where we had a little support from our coach. Here we were then able to access the 'post' data and link each post to a 'user' using the populate feature of Mongoose.

On Friday, we had a retrospective meeting, planning to apply more Agile methodologies to our workflow in the following week.
