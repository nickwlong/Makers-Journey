# Week 9&10 - Building upon legacy code in a MERN stack

## Weekly 

1. Navigate a legacy codebase.
2. Build production-quality software in a team.

#### Evidence:
1. **Week One** WHAAT?! Where do we start? We were shown some existing code for an "Acebook" app, using technologies including:
* JavaScript
* React
* MongoDB
* Mongoose
* Express
* Jest
* Cypress
* JWT 

I had used JavaScript and Express a little previously, but no Mongo or React, and I had no idea what a token represented. However, we started the first day by setting a goal of deciding how we would work as a team and set out to find out the basic structure of the files etc.

Initially, the codebase had features to allow signup, log in, and view posts. However, we didn't have any test posts to view nor a feature to implement. So I found a way to insert many test posts, and we had our first feed of posts visible!

By using our trello board, stand-up meetings, and coding in pairs/threes, we implemented some basic features in the first week. For example, reverse-chronological sorting of posts, styling posts as 'cards', and adding the 'date-posted' to each post. We hit a significant blocker when trying to linking tables of data together using MongoDB, where we had a little support from our coach. Here we were then able to access the 'post' data and link each post to a 'user' using the populate feature of Mongoose.

On Friday, we had a retrospective meeting, planning to apply more Agile methodologies to our workflow in the following week.

2. **Week Two**
Into the second week, we were able to introduce a selection of other features such as 'likes' and 'comments', while focussing on managing the styling of the page. These final stages can feel rushed and merging various branches in the last days of the project can be complicated and stressful, so we agreed to aim to implement main features by the end of Wednesday and spend Thursday tidying up and finalising the styling.

Our finished project can be seen here: https://acebook-ovo-frontend.herokuapp.com/ and https://acebook-ovo-backend.herokuapp.com/ (with our database hosted on MongoDB Atlas)

And our Trello: https://trello.com/b/w0xoTYE5/acebook-ovo

The final features included:
* Signup (with validation)
* Login
* See all posts in reverse order
* Create new post (and page updates)
* Like a post
* Delete posts that you have created
* Comment on others' posts
* Sign out
## Reflection

The project was an excellent chance to learn about how to use React and MongoDB. I was able to integrate the more complicated DB, backend and frontend into Heroku and a cloud database. It felt good! There were definitely times in the week where I felt progress was limited because of being a group of 6, and where I felt that maybe I could have completed more if just by myself.. I learned a lot about patience, and prioritised supporting others in the group with their understanding of React/Express/Mongo/Node, and took on some stretch tasks (e.g. setting up Heroku) myself.
