# Week 8 - Learning a new language

## Weekly Goals

1. Describe a process for learning a new language
2. Follow an effective process for learning a new language
3. Compare and contrast Javascript and Ruby
4. Test drive a simple front-end web app with Javascript

#### Plans to achieve:

I started the week by asking the question: What would my plan be if I were to start learning another new language tomorrow? 

The main aim will be able to follow specifications to build simple programs in Javascript using TDD and OOD. I will then look to create front-end web apps using Javascript. Test-driven development needs to be at the core of all of this.

1. Use the Makers resources to develop my understanding of the Ruby language
2. Apply what I have learned to drills and small projects
3. To work with others via pair programming to refactor my code

#### Evidence:
1. **Day One** WHAAT?! Where do we start? We were shown some existing code for an "Acebook" app, using technologies including:
* JavaScript
* React
* MongoDB
* Mongoose
* Express
* Jest
* Cypress
* JWT 

I had used JavaScript and Express
